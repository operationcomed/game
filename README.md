If it doesn't work try:
* Installing python https://www.python.org/downloads/
* If you already have python installed, try running this command in a terminal (look up a tutorial on how to open a terminal on your OS): `python -m pip install panda3d` or `python3 -m pip install panda3d`
  * If you get an error like `No module named pip`, try running this command then try the above again: `python -m ensurepip` or `python3 -m ensurepip`
